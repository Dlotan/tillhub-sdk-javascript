# Tillhub JavaScript SDK [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tillhub/tillhub-sdk-javascript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tillhub/tillhub-sdk-javascript)

## Usage

```bash
# Run npm install and write your library name when asked. That's all!
npm install tillhub-js
```

## Features

## Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import * as tillhub from 'tillhub-js'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import Auth from 'tillhub-sdk/dist/lib/Auth'
```
